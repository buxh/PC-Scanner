## Disclaimer
- Not the best but it gets the job done kinda
- This was created in November 2020
- **THIS SHOULD NOT REPLACE YOUR CURRENT ANTI-VIRUS SCANNER**
- I have not coded in batch in over a year because it's terrible so don't ask me for help just look it up on google ðŸ’€

## Features
- Attempts to find active connections
- Collects all running exe's names
- Locates all local appdata & appdata file names
- Gathers all start up file names
- Opens start up folders
- Grants you the ability to upload the file names and send them to a discord webhook
- Uploaded via curl to [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh)
- Very easy to use

## How to use
i. Create a [webhook](https://www.socialoomph.com/help/view/help_discord_webhook_how/).

ii. Right click and edit `Scanner.bat` then replace "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_WEBHOOK" on [line 17](https://github.com/buxh/PC-Scanner/blob/main/Scanner.bat#L17) with your webhook.
```bat
set webhook=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_WEBHOOK
```
iii. If done successfully then it should look something like this.
```bat
set webhook=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/172979283729726/URnyhuVL24vJ9pAFOeBFHAZSU2eCRAEEQSLl1NPrbYWDrsO8SLiNwmQ5vvxDmj_nkZqg
```
iv. Save the file and run!
